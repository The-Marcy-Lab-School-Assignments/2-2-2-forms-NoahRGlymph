# Question

Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer

Submit sends the data in the form to the searchbar/url-bar.

Reset clears the form.

Button creates a button in the html file.

Good start in recognizing the default behavior of form submission, but remember to elaborate on how to use event.preventDefault() effectively to prevent the page from refreshing, and consider mentioning the aspect of sending form data to a server for a more comprehensive understanding.
