# Question

Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```

to this:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer

When you click the submit button, the data in the form goes to the browsers searchbar. This a default behavior, and it can be fixed by stop the reload/redirect with: event.preventDefault();

Good start in recognizing the default behavior of form submission. Consider mentioning the aspect of sending form data to a server for a more comprehensive understanding.
